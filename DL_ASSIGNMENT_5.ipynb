        "1. **Why would you want to use the Data API?**\n",
        "   - The Data API helps load and process data efficiently during training. It handles large datasets, reduces memory usage, and speeds up training.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What are the benefits of splitting a large dataset into multiple files?**\n",
        "   - Splitting a large dataset into smaller files can make data loading faster, easier to manage, and less prone to failure if a file gets corrupted.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **During training, how can you tell that your input pipeline is the bottleneck? What can you do to fix it?**\n",
        "   - You can tell if the input pipeline is slow if the GPU or CPU is idle while waiting for data. To fix it, you can optimize data loading, use prefetching, or parallel processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Can you save any binary data to a TFRecord file, or only serialized protocol buffers?**\n",
        "   - You can save any binary data to a TFRecord file, not just serialized protocol buffers. This makes TFRecords versatile for different types of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Why would you go through the hassle of converting all your data to the Example protobuf format? Why not use your own protobuf definition?**\n",
        "   - Using the Example protobuf format is a standard approach and well-supported by TensorFlow tools, ensuring compatibility and simplifying the data handling process.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **When using TFRecords, when would you want to activate compression? Why not do it systematically?**\n",
        "   - Activate compression to save storage space and reduce I/O time for large datasets. However, avoid it for small datasets or when the compression/decompression overhead is too high.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Data can be preprocessed directly when writing the data files, or within the tf.data pipeline, or in preprocessing layers within your model, or using TF Transform. Can you list a few pros and cons of each option?**\n",
        "   - **Preprocessing when writing data files:**\n",
        "     - **Pros:** Faster training, consistent preprocessing.\n",
        "     - **Cons:** Less flexibility, harder to update preprocessing steps.\n",
        "   - **Preprocessing in the tf.data pipeline:**\n",
        "     - **Pros:** Flexible, can adjust preprocessing during training.\n",
        "     - **Cons:** May slow down training if complex.\n",
        "   - **Preprocessing in model layers:**\n",
        "     - **Pros:** Simplifies input pipeline, preprocessing tied to model.\n",
        "     - **Cons:** Slower training, preprocessing re-run every epoch.\n",
        "   - **Using TF Transform:**\n",
        "     - **Pros:** Consistent preprocessing for training and serving.\n",
        "     - **Cons:** Steeper learning curve, more setup needed."
