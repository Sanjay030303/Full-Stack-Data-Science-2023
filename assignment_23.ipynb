        "1. **What is the result of the code, and why?**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   >>> def func(a, b=6, c=8):\n",
        "   ...     print(a, b, c)\n",
        "   >>> func(1, 2)\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Output and Explanation:**\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   1 2 8\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "   In this function call, `func(1, 2)`, `a` is assigned 1, `b` is explicitly passed as 2, and `c` retains its default value of 8. Therefore, when the function `func()` is executed, it prints `1 2 8`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is the result of this code, and why?**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   >>> def func(a, b, c=5):\n",
        "   ...     print(a, b, c)\n",

        "   1 2 3\n",
        "   ```\n",

        "3. **How about this code: what is its result, and why?**\n",

        "   - `a` is reassigned to 2, but since `a` is an integer (`l`), it remains unaffected outside the function.\n",
