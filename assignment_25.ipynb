        "1. **What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?**\n",
        "   - When you enclose a list comprehension in **square brackets** (`[ ]`), it creates a list. For example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     This creates a list `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16]`.\n",
        "   - When you enclose a list comprehension in **parentheses** (`( )`), it creates a generator object. For example:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     squares_gen = (x**2 for x in range(5))\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     This creates a generator object, which generates values lazily when iterated over.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **What is the relationship between generators and iterators?**\n",
        "   - **Generators** are a special type of iterator. They are created using the `yield` statement or as generator expressions `( )`. Generators generate values on-the-fly and only store the state of the iteration.\n",
        "   - **Iterators** are objects that implement the iterator protocol, which includes methods like `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. Iterators can be created from any iterable using the `iter()` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What are the signs that a function is a generator function?**\n",
        "   - A function is a generator function if it contains at least one `yield` statement.\n",
        "   - Instead of returning a value using `return`, generator functions use `yield` to produce a series of values when iterated over.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **What is the purpose of a yield statement?**\n",
        "   - The `yield` statement is used in generator functions to produce a series of values one at a time.\n",
        "   - It suspends the functionâ€™s execution and saves its state so that it can be resumed later, allowing the generator to produce a sequence of values lazily.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.**\n",
        "   - **Map calls (`map()`):**\n",
        "     - `map()` applies a function to each item in an iterable (like a list) and returns an iterator that yields the results.\n",
        "     - Example:\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       squares_map = map(lambda x: x**2, range(5))\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "     - It's concise but can be less readable when using complex functions.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **List comprehensions:**\n",
        "     - List comprehensions build lists by evaluating an expression for each item in an iterable.\n",
        "     - Example:\n",
        "       ```python\n",
        "       squares_list = [x**2 for x in range(5)]\n",
        "       ```\n",
        "     - More readable and can include conditions (`if` statements) and nested loops.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Comparison:**\n",
        "     - Both `map()` and list comprehensions can be used to apply a function to every item in an iterable.\n",
        "     - List comprehensions are generally more readable and easier to understand, especially for simple transformations.\n",
        "     - `map()` can be more concise and may perform better in some cases, especially when using built-in functions or lambdas.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Contrast:**\n",
        "     - List comprehensions create lists directly, while `map()` returns an iterator that needs to be converted to a list or iterated over.\n",
        "     - List comprehensions support more complex operations like filtering (`if` statements) and nested loops, which can make them more versatile.\n",
        "     - `map()` is limited to applying a function to each item without additional conditions or nested structures.\n"
