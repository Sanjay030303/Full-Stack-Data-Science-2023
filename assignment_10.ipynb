        "\n",
        "   shutil.copy() is used to copy a single file from one location to another, whereas shutil.copytree() is used to copy an entire directory tree, including all files and subdirectories, to a new location.\n",
        "\n",

        "   The send2trash module's delete function moves files and folders to the recycle bin or trash, allowing for recovery, while shutil's delete functions, such as shutil.rmtree(), permanently delete files and directories, making them unrecoverable.\n",
