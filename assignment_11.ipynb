        "2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different.\n",

        "5. What are the two lines that your program must have in order to have logging.debug() send a logging message to a file named programLog.txt?\n",

        "\n",
        "8. Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
        "   - Logging messages can be easily controlled, filtered, and directed to different outputs like files, and they include timestamps and severity levels.\n",

        "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",

        "10. After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop?\n",
        "    - The debugger will stop when it reaches the next breakpoint or encounters an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the concept of a breakpoint?\n",
        "    - A breakpoint is a marker set by the programmer where the debugger will pause execution, allowing inspection of the program's state."
