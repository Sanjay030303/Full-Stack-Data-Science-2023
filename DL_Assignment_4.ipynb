        "1. **How would you describe TensorFlow in a short sentence? What are its main features? Can you name other popular Deep Learning libraries?**\n",
        "   - TensorFlow is a powerful open-source library for numerical computation and machine learning, known for its flexibility and scalability. Its main features include automatic differentiation, GPU acceleration, and support for distributed computing. Other popular deep learning libraries include PyTorch, Keras, and MXNet.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Is TensorFlow a drop-in replacement for NumPy? What are the main differences between the two?**\n",
        "   - No, TensorFlow is not a drop-in replacement for NumPy. While both handle numerical computations, TensorFlow is designed for deep learning and includes operations for automatic differentiation, GPU support, and distributed computing. TensorFlow uses a symbolic execution model, whereas NumPy uses an imperative execution model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Do you get the same result with tf.range(10) and tf.constant(np.arange(10))?**\n",
        "   - Yes, both `tf.range(10)` and `tf.constant(np.arange(10))` will give you a TensorFlow tensor containing values `[0, 1, 2, ..., 9]`. However, they are created differently—one using TensorFlow's function and the other by converting a NumPy array.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Can you name six other data structures available in TensorFlow, beyond regular tensors?**\n",
        "   - Other data structures in TensorFlow include `SparseTensor` for efficiently representing sparse data, `RaggedTensor` for handling sequences of varying lengths, `TensorArray` for storing tensors of varying lengths dynamically, `Queue` for managing input pipelines, `Dataset` for efficient data handling, and `Variable` for mutable tensors that can be modified during execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **A custom loss function can be defined by writing a function or by subclassing the `keras.losses.Loss` class. When would you use each option?**\n",
        "   - Use a function when the loss calculation is straightforward and doesn't require additional state or attributes. Subclass `keras.losses.Loss` when you need to maintain state across batches, compute metrics during training, or implement a complex custom loss involving layers or metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Similarly, a custom metric can be defined in a function or a subclass of `keras.metrics.Metric`. When would you use each option?**\n",
        "   - Use a function when the metric computation is straightforward and doesn't need to maintain state or additional attributes. Subclass `keras.metrics.Metric` when you need to maintain state across batches, compute metrics that require aggregation (like mean or sum), or implement a custom metric involving layers or additional logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **When should you create a custom layer versus a custom model?**\n",
        "   - Create a custom layer when you want to define new operations on tensors (like convolution, activation, etc.) that are reusable across different models. Create a custom model when you want to define a new architecture or combination of layers that represents a complete neural network, possibly with custom training loops or additional logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What are some use cases that require writing your own custom training loop?**\n",
        "   - Custom training loops are necessary when you want precise control over training dynamics, such as implementing advanced learning rate schedules, handling complex loss functions, applying gradient clipping, or integrating external logic during training steps (like data augmentation or custom validation schemes).\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Can custom Keras components contain arbitrary Python code, or must they be convertible to TF Functions?**\n",
        "   - Custom Keras components must be convertible to TF Functions if you want to benefit from graph optimization and performance gains. However, they can contain arbitrary Python code for initialization, bookkeeping, or interfacing with external libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What are the main rules to respect if you want a function to be convertible to a TF Function?**\n",
        "    - To convert a function to a TF Function, ensure that all operations inside the function are compatible with TensorFlow's computational graph (e.g., use TensorFlow operations, avoid using Python constructs that TensorFlow can't optimize like loops over dynamic lengths).\n",
        "\n",
        "11. **When would you need to create a dynamic Keras model? How do you do that? Why not make all your models dynamic?**\n",
        "    - Create a dynamic Keras model when you need to handle inputs with varying shapes or lengths dynamically during training or inference (e.g., NLP models with variable-length sequences). You can achieve this by using layers like `tf.keras.Input` with dynamic shape dimensions. Not all models need to be dynamic; static models can offer better performance optimizations and graph compilation benefits when input shapes are fixed."
